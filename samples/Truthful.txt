I arrived at my desk at 8:00 AM and I immediately opened the secure folder to finish the report. I remember saving the files at 9:30 AM because I had a deadline for the board meeting. 
I stayed at my computer until 11:00 AM, then I locked my screen and went to the cafeteria with Mark. I am certain I saw the folder on my desktop before I left. When I came back twenty minutes later, I unlocked my station and I noticed the folder was empty. 
I immediately called the IT department to report the incident because I was worried about the data.
