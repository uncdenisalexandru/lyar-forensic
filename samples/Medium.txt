I was working late that night, probably until 8 PM. I think I left the office through the main entrance like I always do. Honestly, the day was so long and I was exhausted, so I don't recall exactly if I swiped my card or if someone else held the door for me. 
Then, basically, I went straight to the parking lot. Later, I realized that I might have forgotten to double-check the lock on the server room, but I suppose it could have been anyone else who passed by. 
I believe I was being careful enough, but anyway, it is just one of those things that happens when you are under a lot of pressure.
